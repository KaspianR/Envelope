# Envelope
Envelope is a simple yet powerful **Bukkit** and **Spigot** plugin that allows for sending and receiving envelopes and packages containing various things. The plugin also adds letterboxes in 13 different colors. Both the letterboxes and packages feature custom textures (made out of custom player heads) and the envelopes is a standard paper with a few custom attributes. Most things are, as of version 2, customizable through the config and the custom GUI interface is clear and easy to use.
